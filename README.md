How Amazon Prime Video can provide you actors’ information whenever you hit pause during a show?
Let's go through a step by step description of a procedure to tag the face of every person who appears in a video. Explore the theory and the coding behind this uncanny ability by the [**face-recognition-pipeline.ipynb**](https://github.com/elenagiarratano/face-recognition-pipeline/blob/master/face-recognition-pipeline.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook.

## Requirements
All you need is stored in the **python-venv** folder and explained in detail in the **Settings.xlsx** document.
Basically, you have two options:
- Set up your virtual Pyhton environment by means of the **requirements.txt** file — find out the complete list of the required Python packages along with the used versions.
- [Download](http://jarvis.datareply.eu:8000/f/756aaae38e0741dcb13f/?dl=1) and import the **FaceRecognition_Mint64.ova** file into your favorite VM tool, if you are more confortable to set up a pre-configured Virtual Machine.

## An example
What we got when the machine is applied to the theme song of the TV show _Person of Interest_.
